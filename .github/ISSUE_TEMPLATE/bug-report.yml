        Please include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. Attach or link a project if you have one, even if it is very simple. It helps to quickly evaluate and diagnose the issue and ensures any fix addresses your scenario. If you cannot attach a project, include the smallest possible code snippet, with steps to run it. If possible include text as text rather than screenshots (so it shows up in searches).
